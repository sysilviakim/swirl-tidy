    Welcome back! Today we will continue to explore how to visualize your data
    using {ggplot2} package. When you see ..., press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >-
    Run {install.packages("tidyverse")}, if it is not already installed.
    You can type "skip()" if this package is already installed.
    Remember to close all other sessions of R (if Windows) before this step.
    Otherwise, you may run into error messages such as 'Warning in
    install.packages : installation of package ‘XXX’ had non-zero exit status'.
  CorrectAnswer: if (!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
  AnswerTests: >-
    any_of_exprs(
      'install.packages(pkgs = "tidyverse")',
      'if (!require("tidyverse")) install.packages(pkgs = "tidyverse")',
      'install.packages("tidyverse")',
      'if (!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")',
      'skip()'
    )
  Hint: 'If the package is already installed, type skip().'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Now load the tidyverse package.'
  CorrectAnswer: library("tidyverse")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('library(tidyverse)', 'library("tidyverse")')
  Hint: 'Avoid using {require}. Use {library}.'

# PREAMBLE =====================================================================
## demo_lesson(4)
- Class: text
  Output: >-
    Welcome back! We really covered lots of ground in the first two lessons of
    ggplot2. Congratulations on making so far.

## demo_lesson(5)
- Class: text
  Output: >-
    So what's left? In this final ggplot2 lesson, we will cover a few important
    aesthetical choices such as axis titles and labels and
    adding horizontal/vertical lines.

## demo_lesson(6)
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >-
    Let's again load the dataset that we will use: "economics."
    Note that this is not achieved through {load} but with {data}!
  CorrectAnswer: data("economics")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('data(economics)', 'data("economics")', 'skip()')
  Hint: 'Use {data} function to load the "economics" dataset.'

## demo_lesson(7)
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >-
    Draw a time-series of `date` and `psaavert` as we have done before, using
    {geom_line}. For this question, make sure that {aes} is specified within
    {ggplot}, not {geom_line}.
  CorrectAnswer: >-
    ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = psavert)) +
      geom_line()
  AnswerTests: >-
    omnitest(
      correctExpr = '
      ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = psavert)) + geom_line()'
    )
  Hint: 'Add a line using {geom_line} to the previous answer!'

## demo_lesson(8)
- Class: text
  Output: >-
    Note how the y-axis label, although technically correct, is not very
    informative. We will definitely forget what `psavert` stood for, and other
    people who may use this plot will also need to look up the data
    description!


    To prevent this, let's put a more informative label on the y-axis.

## demo_lesson(9)
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >-
    There are several ways to do this, but let's first learn to use functions
    such as {ylab} and {xlab}. Add a line to the last code using the `+`
    operator: {ylab("Personal Savings Rate")}.
  CorrectAnswer: >-
    ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = psavert)) +
      geom_line() +
      ylab("Personal Savings Rate")
  AnswerTests: >-
    omnitest(
      correctExpr = '
      ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = psavert)) +
        geom_line() +
        ylab("Personal Savings Rate")
      '
    )
  Hint: 'Add a line using {ylab} to the previous answer!'

## demo_lesson(10)
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >-
    Excellent! Notice how the y-axis label has changed. Now on top of that,
    try changing the x-axis label to "Year". You should use {xlab} for this.
  CorrectAnswer: >-
    ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = psavert)) +
      geom_line() +
      ylab("Personal Savings Rate") +
      xlab("Year")
  AnswerTests: >-
    omnitest(
      correctExpr = '
      ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = psavert)) +
        geom_line() +
        ylab("Personal Savings Rate") +
        xlab("Year")
      '
    )
  Hint: 'Add a line using {xlab} to the previous answer!'

## demo_lesson(11)
- Class: text
  Output: >-
    Very good!


    Now, note how our y-axis is probably percentages, and we might want to
    explicitly specify that. We can do {ylab("Personal Savings Rate (%)"},
    but let's say that we want to turn it to a value between 0-1 instead.
    In that case, we have to rescale the y-axis.

## demo_lesson(12)
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >-
    While we can {mutate} the original dataframe, we can implement this change
    with {ggplot2} as well.


    Since this y-variable is continuous, we will use the following function:
    {scale_y_continuous}. Add {scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) x / 100)}
    to the last answer.
  CorrectAnswer: >-
    ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = psavert)) +
      geom_line() +
      ylab("Personal Savings Rate") +
      xlab("Year") +
      scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) x / 100)
  AnswerTests: >-
    omnitest(
      correctExpr = '
      ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = psavert)) +
        geom_line() +
        ylab("Personal Savings Rate") +
        xlab("Year") +
        scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) x / 100)
      '
    )
  Hint: 'Add a line using {scale_y_continuous} to the previous answer!'

## demo_lesson(13)
- Class: text
  Output: >-
    Great work. The underlying data has not changed, but the labels have changed
    to fit our purposes.


    If you want to, conversely, turn a value in 0-1 into a percentage, you can
    work with the function(x) part, but also use the following:
    {scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)}. Note that the {scales}
    package must be installed.


    If you want to work with variables other than continuous variables,
    there are functions such as {scale_y_discrete}, {scale_x_datetime}, and so
    on.

## demo_lesson(14)
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >-
    Suppose we are not too happy with the limits specified in the axis.
    Suppose we want to see 0% on the y-axis. We can then use the same
    {scale_y_continuous} to specify the limits.


    Substitute {scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) x / 100)} from the
    previous answer with {scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 20))}.
  CorrectAnswer: >-
    ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = psavert)) +
      geom_line() +
      ylab("Personal Savings Rate") +
      xlab("Year") +
      scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 20))
  AnswerTests: >-
    omnitest(
      correctExpr = '
      ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = psavert)) +
        geom_line() +
        ylab("Personal Savings Rate") +
        xlab("Year") +
        scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 20))
      '
    )
  Hint: "Substitute the last answer's last line!"

## demo_lesson(15)
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >-
    To make this more informative, we may want to add horizontal or vertical
    lines to the existing plot. Suppose we want to plot the bankruptcy of
    Lehman Brothers during the 2007-2008 economic crisis to see how it fits
    to the current pattern.


    We can use {geom_vline} to plot a vertical line.
    On top of the last code (that uses limits from 0 to 20),
    add {geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2008-09-15"))}.
  CorrectAnswer: >-
    ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = psavert)) +
      geom_line() +
      ylab("Personal Savings Rate") +
      xlab("Year") +
      scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 20)) +
      geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2008-09-15"))
  AnswerTests: >-
    omnitest(
      correctExpr = '
      ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = psavert)) +
        geom_line() +
        ylab("Personal Savings Rate") +
        xlab("Year") +
        scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 20)) +
        geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2008-09-15"))
      '
    )
  Hint: "Substitute the last answer's last line!"

## demo_lesson(16)
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >-
    *Instead* of the vertical line, try plotting a horizontal line at the
    average value of personal savings, which is roughly 8.5 (so just use 8.5).


    Instead of {geom_vline}, you should be using {geom_hline}, and
    `yintercept` instead of `xintercept` within the function.
  CorrectAnswer: >-
    ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = psavert)) +
      geom_line() +
      ylab("Personal Savings Rate") +
      xlab("Year") +
      scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 20)) +
      geom_hline(yintercept = 8.5)
  AnswerTests: >-
    omnitest(
      correctExpr = '
      ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = psavert)) +
        geom_line() +
        ylab("Personal Savings Rate") +
        xlab("Year") +
        scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 20)) +
        geom_hline(yintercept = 8.5)
      '
    )
  Hint: "Don't use {geom_vline} here but use {geom_hline}."

# SAVING PLOTS =================================================================
## demo_lesson(17)
- Class: text
  Output: >-
    One last important skill: saving your plots to files. While you can use the
    Export button in RStudio's Plots pane, {ggsave} gives you much more control
    and makes your workflow reproducible.

## demo_lesson(18)
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >-
    First, let's store our last plot. Execute
    {my_plot <- ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = psavert)) + geom_line() +
    ylab("Personal Savings Rate") + xlab("Year")}.
  CorrectAnswer: >-
    my_plot <- ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = psavert)) + geom_line() +
    ylab("Personal Savings Rate") + xlab("Year")
  AnswerTests: >-
    omnitest(
      correctExpr = '
      my_plot <- ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = psavert)) + geom_line() +
      ylab("Personal Savings Rate") + xlab("Year")
      '
    )
  Hint: 'Just copy-paste it!'

## demo_lesson(19)
- Class: text
  Output: >-
    Now you can save it with {ggsave}. The typical usage is
    {ggsave("filename.png", plot = my_plot, width = 6, height = 4)}.
    {ggsave} detects the format from the file extension: it supports
    .png, .pdf, .svg, .jpg, and more. The `width` and `height` arguments
    control the dimensions in inches. You can set `dpi` for resolution
    (e.g., `dpi = 300` for publication quality).

## demo_lesson(20)
- Class: text
  Output: >-
    If you omit the `plot` argument, {ggsave} saves the last plot you
    displayed. But it is good practice to always be explicit about which plot
    you are saving.

  Output: >-
    Excellent! So that's a wrap on ggplot2. This last lesson really scrapes the
    surface of the many different dials you can tweak when drawing a ggplot2
    object. I have not covered aesthetical choices such as position
    adjustments (e.g. {geom_bar(position = "fill")}), zooming/clipping, or
    coordinate systems, facetting, and moving legend positions with {theme},
    but I will leave these to you.
