# INTRO ========================================================================

    Welcome aboard! These exercises are created to introduce you to tidyverse
    through a series of interactive exercises. When you see ..., press Enter.

    One thing that should be clear is that people have different opinions about
    which packages they want to rely on. Indeed, the introduction page to
    tidyverse states that it is an "opinionated collection of R packages."
    Using tidyverse as opposed to base R has its pros and cons, but because of
    its consistent and intuitive grammar for data frames, it is widely used.
    
## demo_lesson(3)
- Class: text
  Output: >- 
    For many simple operations, you do not need tidyverse. Besides, many
    components of base R are incorporated into tidyverse code.
    With that in mind, for more information about what tidyverse is, visit
    https://www.tidyverse.org/.

    The current version of this swirl lesson assumes that you have some cursory
    knowledge of the basics of R. These include things such as package
    installation, working directory, library paths, basic arithmetics, objects,
    assignments, Global Environment, and so on. I also suggest reviewing this:
    https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html.
    
## demo_lesson(5)
- Class: text
  Output: >- 
    We will use (1) double quotes to indicate R object names, (2) single quotes
    to indicate character strings, and (3) curly brackets to indicate R syntax
    or package names, and (4) backticks to indicate column names in data frames
    and function argument names.
    All double/single quotes inside curly brackets are as-is.
    
# INSTALLATION =================================================================
## demo_lesson(6)
- Class: text
  Output: >-
    First, let's install tidyverse!
    
## demo_lesson(7)
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >-
    Run {install.packages("tidyverse")}, if it is not already installed.
    You can type "skip()" if this package is already installed.
    Remember to close all other sessions of R (if Windows) before this step.
    Otherwise, you may run into error messages such as 'Warning in
    install.packages : installation of package ‘XXX’ had non-zero exit status'.
  CorrectAnswer: if (!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
  AnswerTests: >-
    any_of_exprs(
      'install.packages(pkgs = "tidyverse")',
      'if (!require("tidyverse")) install.packages(pkgs = "tidyverse")',
      'skip()'
    )
  Hint: 'If the package is already installed, type skip().'
    
## demo_lesson(8)
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >-
    Now that tidyverse is installed, let us load it.
    Type {library("tidyverse")}. This will load 8 different packages
    (as of tidyverse 1.3.0): ggplot2, purrr, tibble, dplyr, tidyr, stringr,
    readr, and forcats.
  CorrectAnswer: library("tidyverse")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('library(tidyverse)', 'library("tidyverse")')
  Hint: >
    Avoid using {require}. Use {library}.

## demo_lesson(9)
- Class: text
  Output: >-
    I will ask you to check installations/call libraries in each lesson.
    This is to prevent an unwanted installation of a new version of an existing
    package or messing with packages already open. 
    
## demo_lesson(10)

    The sequence of lessons follows the data science project workflow by R4DS:
    Wickham, Hadley, and Garrett Grolemund. R for Data Science: Import,
    Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data}. O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2016.
    This is available at https://r4ds.had.co.nz/.
    
## demo_lesson(10)
- Class: text
  Output: >-
    Together, we will move through (1) import, (2) tidy, (3) transform,
    (4) visualize, (5) model, and (6) communication. Many of the exercises are
    based on what R4DS book teaches, or tidyverse cheatsheets available at
    https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/.
    
## demo_lesson(11)
- Class: text
  Output: >-
    Lastly, sometimes it may be a good idea to call each package of tidyverse
    individually as opposed to a one-line {library(tidyverse)}, especially if
    you want to be mindful of which functions you are depending on in your code.
    Sometimes, an issue with updated tidyverse/RStudio may cause the entire code
    to fail. Another possibility is that conflicting function names may get
    overwritten. But this is just for your precaution. In this preliminary foray
    into tidyverse, there will be no such need!
