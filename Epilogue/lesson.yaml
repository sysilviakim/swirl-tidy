    This is a wrap-up to the swirl-tidy lesson.
    We covered a lot of ground in this series of twenty-something swirl lessons.
    
# PREAMBLE =====================================================================
## demo_lesson(4)
- Class: text
  Output: >
    We covered, using tidyverse packages,
    
    
    (1) how to import data
    
    
    (2) how to tidy the data
    
    
    (3) how to transform the data
    
    
    (4) how to visualize the data
    
    
    (5) how to better program 
    
    
    (6) how to create statistical models
    
## demo_lesson(5)
- Class: text
  Output: >
    Some packages that are part of the tidyverse that are not covered here
    include {DBI}, {httr}, {jsonlite}, {xml2} (although this is loaded when
    we worked with {rvest}), {hms}, {blob}, and {glue}.

  Output: >
    I also haven't covered {magrittr}, which is commonly used, but currently
    this package is undergoing a major overhaul to magrittr 2.0, so I will wait
    to see what I want to include in the lesson.

  Output: >
    Again, as we saw with {rvest}, tidyverse alone may not be an answer to
    everything. Look up StackOverflow if you have specific needs that are not
    met.

    * If you work with large datasets, I urge you to check out {data.table} by
    Matt Dowle at https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table.
    
    
    * If you work a lot with machine learning, check out {caret} by Max Kuhn
    at https://topepo.github.io/caret/. 
    
    
    * {xtable} is a great package to export your data/model summaries into 
    tables, especially LaTeX files. This will be extremely useful in making
    your results reproducible.
