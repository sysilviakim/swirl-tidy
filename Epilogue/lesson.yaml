    This is a wrap-up to the swirl-tidy lesson.
    We covered a lot of ground in this series of twenty-something swirl lessons.
    
# PREAMBLE =====================================================================
## demo_lesson(4)
- Class: text
  Output: >
    We covered, using tidyverse packages,
    
    
    (1) how to import data
    
    
    (2) how to transform the data
    
    
    (3) how to visualize the data
    
## demo_lesson(5)

  Output: >
    Some key packages that are part of the tidyverse that are not covered here
    include {purrr}, {tidyr}, {forcats}, {stringr}, {magrittr}, and many more. 
    
    I hope to cover them eventually in a more comprehensive, advanced set of 
    swirl exercises.

    Note that tidyverse alone may not be an answer to everything.
    Look up StackOverflow if you have specific needs that are not met.

    * If you work with large datasets, I urge you to check out {data.table} by
    Matt Dowle at https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table.
    
    
    * If you work a lot with machine learning, check out {caret} by Max Kuhn
    at https://topepo.github.io/caret/. (Note also {modelr} of {tidyverse}.)
    
    
    * {xtable} is a great package to export your data/model summaries into 
    tables, especially LaTeX files. This will be extremely useful in making
    your results reproducible. Similarly, {stargazer} is also useful.
