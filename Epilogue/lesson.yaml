    This is a wrap-up to the swirl-tidy lesson.
    We covered a lot of ground in this series of twenty swirl lessons.

# PREAMBLE =====================================================================
## demo_lesson(4)
- Class: text
  Output: >
    We covered, using tidyverse packages,


    (1) how to import and export data (readr, haven, readxl)


    (2) how to transform the data (dplyr, tidyr)


    (3) how to work with strings and factors (stringr, forcats)


    (4) how to work with dates (lubridate)


    (5) how to iterate with purrr


    (6) how to visualize the data (ggplot2)

## demo_lesson(5)

    Some tidyverse-adjacent packages that are not covered here include
    {magrittr} for advanced piping, {glue} for string interpolation,
    and many more. Check out the full tidyverse ecosystem at
    https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/.

    Note that tidyverse alone may not be an answer to everything.
    Look up StackOverflow if you have specific needs that are not met.

    * If you work with large datasets, I urge you to check out {data.table} by
    Matt Dowle at https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table.


    * If you work a lot with machine learning, check out {tidymodels} at
    https://www.tidymodels.org/, the tidyverse-aligned modeling framework
    by Max Kuhn and others. Also worth noting is {caret} (also by Max Kuhn),
    a non-tidyverse package at https://topepo.github.io/caret/.


    * {xtable} is a great package to export your data/model summaries into
    tables, especially LaTeX files. This will be extremely useful in making
    your results reproducible. Similarly, {stargazer} is also useful.
